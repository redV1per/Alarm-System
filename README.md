# Security Alarm System-simulation-using-Phillips-LPC2148-Microcontroller
This project uses LPC2148 microcontroller to configure sound sensors, LED's, UART and LCD which work as a security alarm system. When sound is detected, the LED's go off and the indication is shown in the LCD screen as "Sound detected". The UART can be used to switch ON and OFF the sound sensors.The state of the sound sensor is also shown in the LCD screen
